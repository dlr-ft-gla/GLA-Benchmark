### Welcome to the CRM GLA Benchmark repository!

This is a highly representative benchmark for lidar-based gust load alleviation. It includes a linear aeroelastic model of the Common Research model (CRM), a surrogate model of a Doppler lidar wind sensor, and a wind reconstruction algorithm. 

It is described in a paper presented at AIAA SciTech 2022: [Gust Load Control Design Challenge Including Lidar Wind measurements and Based on the Common Research Model](https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-1934))

To get started, check out the [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/dlr-ft-gla/GLA-Benchmark/wiki).

The contents of the benchmark are released under permissive, non-contaminating licenses which do not restrict, among other things, commercial use. 
The s-functions containing the lidar model and wind reconstruction algorithm are released under a CC-BY-ND 4.0 license, whereas the rest is released under an MIT license. More details can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/dlr-ft-gla/GLA-Benchmark/wiki/General-Info).

This benchmark is a work in progress, and will likely be updated in the future.

In case of bugs or requests, don't hesitate to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/dlr-ft-gla/GLA-Benchmark/issues).
